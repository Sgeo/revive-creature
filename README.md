# revive-creature
Bring Creatures 3 and Docking Station creatures back from the dead!

## Usage
`revive-creature.exe < dead.creature > revived.creature`

## Download

https://github.com/Sgeo/revive-creature/releases/latest

## Notes
* The fact that the creature died is stored in the world. So if it did in world A, you might have trouble importing it into world A.
* This utility does not yet clear out the death event from the history. If the creature is not cloned (e.g. due to bypass cloning tools), some UI elements may get confused
